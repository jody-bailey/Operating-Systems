# Operating Systems Assignment

This program will create four data sets of random integers between 0-99 and
then another data set of random integers between 1-3 used for priority.
These data sets are then used to create queues of 10 members and then
members will be deleted and inserted to move them through the list until
all of the arrays have been processed.

This code is from my project that I had to do in Operating Systems class at the University of Southern Mississippi. 
It demonstrates how a system is affected by how many processors it has available to complete a task.
